# Consensus Network Simulator - Simulation Engine

CNS-Engine is the object-oriented framework that lies at the core of CNS, a toolset for simulating blockchain consensus networks. The engine offers a set of abstractions, objects, and routines for quickly developing and running event-driven simulators of individual consensus networks. As such it is meant to be used as a library of *instantiating projects* to use in order to analyze specific protocols.

## Installation

At this stage, the easiest way to instantiate CNS-Engine assets is through installation to your local Maven repository:

0. Have the latest versions of `maven`, `git` and `Java` (version used: 21) installed in your system.
1. In the `cns-engine` directory just do:

```
mvn install
```

this will compile and install the library to your local Maven repo.

2. In your instantiating code then (e.g. `cns-bitcoin`) just add this to your `pom.xml`

```
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>dom.institution.lab</groupId>
    <artifactId>cns-engine</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Ensure that the version is the same as in the `pom.xml` at the root of this repository.

## Documentation

* Markdown documentation viewable on GitHub can be found under [src/site/markdown/documentation](src/site/markdown/documentation).
* Complete html documents including JavaDocs can be found under `docs/index.html` - repo needs to be cloned for these to be viewed locally.

## Clarification on License

LGPL license adoption is intended to allow reuse of the framework for instantiating both proprietary and open-source (of any license) consensus protocol simulators. You can, for example create a proprietary tool for simulating a popular consensus protocol using this library a derivative of which you can maintain and distribute.

However, while the instantiating code per se can be proprietary, the derivatives and re-distributions of the CNS-Engine assets themselves need to follow the open source GPL provisions, chiefly that the code is open and under the same license.
